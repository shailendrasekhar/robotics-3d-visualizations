# Mobile Robotics 3D Visualizations

An interactive educational website featuring 3D visualizations for mobile robotics concepts.

## Features

- **Euler Angles Visualization**: Interactive exploration of roll, pitch, and yaw rotations
- **Coordinate Frames**: Understanding different reference frames in robotics
- **Quaternions**: Advanced rotation representations and their applications

## Technologies Used

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D graphics rendering
- dat.GUI for interactive controls
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Live Demo

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. No build process required - it's a static website!

## Educational Content

This website is designed to help students understand:
- 3D rotations and transformations
- Euler angles and their limitations (gimbal lock)
- Rotation matrices and their properties
- Coordinate frame transformations
- Quaternion mathematics and advantages
